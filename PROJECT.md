# PROJECT GUIDELINES: BASIC WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT USING HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT

## Objective

To design and develop a simple yet functional website that demonstrates your understanding of the core web technologies:
HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (interactivity). Students will also learn how to host and publish their
projects online using GitHub Pages.

### I. PROJECT OVERVIEW

Each student (or group) will create a 5–10-page website on a topic of their choice. The website should reflect proper
use of HTML semantics, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality.

### II. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

#### A. HTML (Structure)

* Must include header, navigation bar, main content, and footer.
* Use proper semantic tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).
* At least one multimedia element (image, video, or audio).
* Include internal and external links.
* Include a form (e.g., contact form or feedback form).

#### B. CSS (Design)

* Use an external CSS stylesheet.
* Use selectors, classes, and IDs.
* Utilize layout management (Flexbox or Grid).
* Consistent color scheme and typography.
* Include hover effects or transitions.

#### C. JavaScript (Interactivity)

* Form validation.
* Image slideshow or carousel.
* Interactive navigation menu.
* Dynamic content update (e.g., greeting based on time).
* Simple animation or toggle effect.

#### D. General Requirements

* Minimum of 5 HTML pages (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
* Responsive design (desktop and mobile).

Organized folder structure:

```
/project-folder
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── /css
│    └── style.css
├── /js
│    └── script.js
└── /images
```

Include a README.md file describing your project.

### III. POSSIBLE TOPICS OR CATEGORIES

* Business: Café, clothing shop, small local business page
* Education: Online tutorial, subject resource page
* Entertainment: Movie or game fan site, hobby collection page
* Community: Environmental awareness, charity, local event
* Technology: Tech blog, gadget showcase
* Travel: Travel guide, tourist spot recommendations
* Food: Recipe page, restaurant menu

### IV. DEVELOPMENT PHASES

* Planning: Select topic and target audience. Draft wireframes and content outline.
* Designing: Choose color palette, layout, and typography. Create mockups (optional).
* Developing: Code HTML structure, apply CSS styling, and add interactivity with JavaScript.
* Testing: Check responsiveness and test links, forms, and JavaScript features.
* Publishing: Deploy the website using GitHub Pages.

### V. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PUBLISHING ON GITHUB

1. Create a GitHub Account at https://github.com/
2. Create a new repository, name it (e.g., basic-website-project), set visibility to Public, then create it.
3. Upload your files (either via browser upload or Git command line).
4. Enable GitHub Pages under Settings > Pages > Source: main > /(root).
5. Access your website at https://your-username.github.io/repository-name/.

### VI. OUTPUT SUBMISSION

* GitHub repository link
* Live website link (from GitHub Pages)
* Screenshot of homepage
* Short documentation (README.md with overview, features, technologies, and credits)
