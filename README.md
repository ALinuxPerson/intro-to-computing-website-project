# Bigger Brew Cafe Website Project
This is the official front-end repository for the Bigger Brew Cafe website. This project was developed as a college project and is ready for deployment and use by the cafe owner.

## **Project Overview**
The Bigger Brew Cafe website is designed to be a modern, responsive, and easy-to-navigate online presence.

Key Features:
 * **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers.
 * **Menu Display**: Dedicated sections for displaying coffee and food menus.
 * **Customer Feedback**: An anonymous feedback form for collecting customer comments and suggestions.
 * **Privacy Transparency**: A clear, non-technical Privacy Policy accessible via a modal window in the footer.

## **Technical Information and Setup**
This section provides details needed for hosting, maintenance, and future updates.

### Core Tech Stack (Technologies Used)
 * HTML5: Structure and Content
 * CSS3 (Custom CSS): Styling and Layout
 * JavaScript (Vanilla): Provides all front-end interactivity and logic (e.g., handling buttons, animations, and form responses).
 
### **Project Files**
The necessary files for deployment are:

 * **index.html**: The main website structure, containing all the page content and core JavaScript logic (including the privacy modal functionality).
 * **styles.css**: The primary external stylesheet used for the cafe's custom look and feel.
 * **All External JavaScript files**: These files contain the necessary code for specific application features, such as the map display, menu sorting, and other client-side logic.
 * **README.md**: This documentation file.
 * **images/**: Folder containing background images and the cafe logo.
 
### **Deployment Instructions**
This website consists of static files (HTML, CSS, JS) and can be hosted on nearly any web service.

Upload all files and folders (including the IMAGES folder and all JavaScript files) to your hosting provider's root directory (often named public_html or www). Ensure the index.html file is accessible as the primary page.

### **Maintenance**
* Menu Updates: To change menu items or prices, you will need to edit the HTML structure directly within the menu sections of the index.html file.
* Content Updates: To change text on the home or about sections, edit the corresponding sections in index.html.
 
## **Future Development & Updates**
This website is ready to use, but here are suggestions for future enhancements:

1. **Backend Integration**: The current feedback form is a front-end placeholder. It needs a database connection (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB) to actually store submitted comments.
2. **Content Management System (CMS)**: Implement a CMS (like WordPress or Shopify) to allow the cafe owner to update the menu and text without editing the underlying code.
3. **Order Integration**: Add a feature for online ordering and payment processing.
