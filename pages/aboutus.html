                    <h1>Our Story</h1>
                    <p>
                        We launched our franchise on February 14, 2022, after a food tasting that won us over. The early
                        days were tough with low sales and high expenses, but we pushed through with patience, smart
                        budgeting, and a lot of faith.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three years later, we're still standing, still growing, and still grateful. One of our biggest
                        joys
                        is helping working students stay in school, and we're proud to support them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight">
                        Our team's dedication inspires us every day because they are the heart of our journey.
